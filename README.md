# Optime
## Introduction
This is a work-in-progress optimization package.
Currently only a (very basic) genetic algorithm is implemented.

## Installation
I've uploaded an older version of this package to PyPi, but I don't recommend installing that.
Instead, you can use pip to install it directly from GitHub:

    $ python -m pip install 'optime @ git+https://github.com/mtyt/optime'

If you are worried I might break your project by updating optime, you can also install
a specific commit, for example:

    $ python -m pip install 'optime @ git+https://github.com/mtyt/optime@8439669e9028419082028c2c363bb264892dc9ff'

## Examples
- The `examples/` folder contains at least 1 Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use
of optime. 
- The `tests/` folder contains unit-tests for optime, with some very minimal pieces of code.
- [classevy](https://github.com/mtyt/optime) also uses optime internally.
